   2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
   grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
   analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
   distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative version,
   provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of copyright,
   i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010,

   3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on
   or incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make
   the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
   Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
   the changes made to Python.
   
   4. PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS"
   basis.  PSF MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND

   5. PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON
   FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS
   A RESULT OF MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON,
   OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
   
   6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
   breach of its terms and conditions.
   
   7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
   relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and
   Licensee.  This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF
   trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote

   Additional Conditions for this Windows binary build
   ---------------------------------------------------
   
   This program is linked with and uses Microsoft Distributable Code,
   copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation. The Microsoft Distributable Code
   is embedded in each .exe, .dll and .pyd file as a result of running
   the code through a linker.
   
   If you further distribute programs that include the Microsoft
   Distributable Code, you must comply with the restrictions on
   distribution specified by Microsoft. In particular, you must require
   distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect the
   Microsoft Distributable Code at least as much as Microsoft's own
   requirements for the Distributable Code. See Microsoft's documentation
   (included in its developer tools and on its website at microsoft.com)
   for specific details.
   
   Redistribution of the Windows binary build of the Python interpreter
   complies with this agreement, provided that you do not:
   
   - alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in Microsoft's
   Distributable Code;
   
   - use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that
   suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
   
   - distribute Microsoft's Distributable Code to run on a platform other
   than Microsoft operating systems, run-time technologies or application
   platforms; or
   
   - include Microsoft Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or
   unlawful programs.
   
   These restrictions apply only to the Microsoft Distributable Code as
   defined above, not to Python itself or any programs running on the
   Python interpreter. The redistribution of the Python interpreter and
   libraries is governed by the Python Software License included with this
   file, or by other licenses as marked.

     and conversions to other media types.

     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   Creative Commons Legal Code

   CC0 1.0 Universal

      CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
      LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
      ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
      INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
      REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
      PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
      THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
      HEREUNDER.

   Statement of Purpose

   The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
   exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
   and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
   authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

   Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
   the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
   scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
   of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
   works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
   and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
   These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
   culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
   works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
   part through the use and efforts of others.

   For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
   expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
   associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
   is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
   elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
   terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
   Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
   limited to, the following:

   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
      directive); and
   vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.

   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
   of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
   irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
   Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
   of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
   future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
   worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
   treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
   medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
   including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
   purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
   member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
   successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
   revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
   equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
   as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
   be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
   Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
   account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
   extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
   person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
   time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
   of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
   limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
   "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
   applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
   reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
   partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
   of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
   will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
   Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
   action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
   express Statement of Purpose.

   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
      title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
      infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
      the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
      the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
      Work.
   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
      this CC0 or use of the Work.
